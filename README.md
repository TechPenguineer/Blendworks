# What is Blendworks?

Blendworks is a [Blender](https://blender.org) plugin that makes Blender easier to use for beginers!

We implement GUIS to make those confusing names more understandable. For example we change **Passive** to **Collider**. We changes **Rigidbody** to **Physics Object**. We also made a gui for all those hidden keybinds.
